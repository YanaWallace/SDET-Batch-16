Important things to keep in mind for this course:
1) Pay attention during the class.
2) Before each class I will be sharing short videos and the class. It's a must that you go through those
 slides and watch the videos in the course announcement channel.
3) A lot of practice.
4) When practicing if you face any issues don't spend more than 15 minutes take a screenshot and post in the
  technical support channel.

Why we are here?
   1) To be automation engineers.
What do automation engineers do?
   They test softwear, but mainly you will be testing webdite and mobile appsby writing a piece of software
    that will test the websites automatically.
Why are we learning Java?
   Java is the programming laguage that we will be using to communicate with the computer on how to test a
   website automatically.
How Programming languages work?
   They work in a very similar fashion just like how human languages work.
   They have grammar rules, vocabulary, punctuation etc.
   In this part of the course we will be learning these rules for Java.
What is Intellij?
   Intellij is the software that we will be using to write Java code just like we use Microsoft Word
   to write English. It has many features like it can find and fix issues in our code. It can suggest
   improvements. It can assist you to organize your code and so many other things.
What is the project in Intellij?
   A project is nothing but a folder that we create to organize our code just like we create folders
   on our computer to organize files.
How to create a project?
   1) File=>new=>project.
   2) Once you follow the above steps you will see a pop
   3) provide the name for the project and click on create.
What is package?
   A packege is nothing but another folder inside the project folder we create packages to organize code.
How can I create a package?
   1) Right click on src folder=>new=> package
   2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name for packege
How to create Notes.txt file?
   1)Right click on src folder=> new=> file
   2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name of the file and the extension .txt
What is a class?
   A class is a Java program where we willbe writing our code.
   Inside the classes we will be creating main method and for now we will write all of our code inside
   the main method.
How to create a class?
   1) Rigt click on the packege=> new=> java class.
   2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name for the class.
   Classes follow a convention that first letter of all the words should be upper case and there can't
   be any spaces between words.
Some shortcuts to write code quickly:
   1)To create the main method we just write "main" and hit the enter button and intellij will automatically
    write a method for you.
   2) To print something on the console we write "sout" and hit the enter button or the tab button and it
   shoud auto complete the print statement for you.
